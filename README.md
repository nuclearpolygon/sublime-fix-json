This package is intended to pretty format json and python dict like objects.  
Unlike Pretty Json package this one tries to fix single quotes, True, False, None and something else.  
Usage `Ctrl+Shift+P` -> `JsonFixUp: Format Json`  
This will take the current tab content and try to fix it and then pretty format it back into the tab
